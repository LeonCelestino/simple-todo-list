# simple-todo-list
this is my first react app. I have started to study it this weak


### WHAT I LEARN

I have learned how to use useStates and controlled inputs, then, I have combined this two ideas and I did a very simple todo list.


### RECENT COMMIT:

Added feature to remove item from list using arr.splice() method.
